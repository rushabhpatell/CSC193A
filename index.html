    <h1>Welcome to My Interesting Page</h1>
    <p>This is my page about <strong>space exploration</strong>, which I find fascinating. Did you know that NASA's <strong>Perseverance rover</strong> is currently exploring Mars? You can learn more about it on the <a href="https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/" target="_blank">official Mars 2020 mission website</a>.</p>
